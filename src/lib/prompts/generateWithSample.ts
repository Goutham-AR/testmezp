## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a {{ language }} source file. Your goal is to generate comprehensive unit tests in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- A sample file and its test file is given as a guide to generate for the source file.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called '{{ sourceFileName }}'.
=========
{{ sourceFileContent }}
=========

## Sample File
Here is the sample source file.
=========
{{ sampleSourceFileContent }}
=========

## Sample Test File
Here is the test file for sample source file above
=========
{{ sampleTestFileContent }}
=========

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is '{{ testFramework }}'.

## Response
The output should be a valid program of {{ language }} language. Additional notes should be included as comments only.`;
